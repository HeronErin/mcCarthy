The extensible, fast, minecraft protocol implementation in C.


## Building

You must have gcc, and gnu make installed to build. This is Linux only. You *MUST* clone using the `recursive` flag.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HeronErin/mcCarthy.git
```
Then you can build with
```bash
make
```
